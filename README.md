# Overview 

LLMs and AI generally have been advancing massively since late 2022. Most notably - combining your own data with LLMs unlocks incredible use cases.

Yet this now comes at a price. 

1. The price of **privacy**. When you search your documents or ask a question, your data is sent to external servers and models - rendering its use potentially prohibitive for many use cases. 
2. The price of **control**. The data you received comes from a model and embeddings you probably haven't chosen. 

native's goal is to give both privacy and control back to users. 

We offer a UI to run LLM apps on your desktop, privately and on your terms. We run on Linux, macOs and Windows. 


# Get started 

Download the  directly from Github or from [native.site](https://native.site) and get started üî•

## Demo 




# Features 
- Private : Your embeddings and your models stay on your computer by default. 
- Powerful : Run the latest models and LLM libraries
- Easy : A simple UI allows everyone to use the latest LLM models. 
- Free & Open : Download and run it. Nothing else. 
- Customizable : Built to be hackable. 


# Structure 

native uses tauri alongside Nextjs and Fastapi to run cross browser. 

You can run from the root of the repository. 

```shell
tauri run dev
```

To build the desktop app. 

More information [here](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/building/)

Running the UI and the server separetily is possible. 

Run the frontend from the /frontend folder:

```shell
nmp run dev
```

Run the backend from the /backend folder

```shell
python3 main.py
```
